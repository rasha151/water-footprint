# Water Footprint Project

## Project Idea:
The "Water Footprint" project aims to raise awareness about the importance of water conservation by understanding the "water footprint," which is the amount of water used to produce the products and services we use daily.

## Project Goal:
To provide simplified information to the public about the water footprint, its environmental impact, and encourage water-saving behaviors in society.

## Context:
This project was developed as part of the **Graduation Project** from the **Ruwad Egyptian Digital Initiative**, which is supported by the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (MCIT). We created a **Motion Graphic Video** to explain the concept of water footprint and its impact.

## Project Importance:
